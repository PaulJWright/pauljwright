### Hi i'm Paul ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a research fellow on an end-to-end machine learning project for solar flare forecasting (ARCAFF).

Prior to joining DIAS in 2023, I was a Senior ML Scientist in a small startup, and an Applied ML Scientist and consultant (https://www.wrightai.com/). From 2019 until 2021, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Physics at Stanford University, and a Core Mentor at the <a href="https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/" target="_blank">NASA Frontier Development Lab</a>. My academic research interests were (and still are) in the application of machine learning in space science. 

Feel free to check out some of the projects I have been involved with, or visit my [personal website](http://pauljwright.co.uk):
