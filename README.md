### Hi i'm Paul ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as an Research Software Engineer at the University of Exeter.

Prior to joining Exeter in 2024, I was an ML Engineer on an end-to-end machine learning project for solar flare forecasting (ARCAFF). Prior to this I was a Senior ML Scientist in a small startup and an Applied ML Scientist and consultant (https://www.wrightai.com/) and prior to 2021 I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Physics at Stanford University, and a Core Mentor at the <a href="https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/" target="_blank">NASA Frontier Development Lab</a>.
